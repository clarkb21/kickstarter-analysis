# Kickstarter Analysis 

## Overview of Project
- Analyze large amounts of data from a kickstarter campaign data set
- Use visualizations to help show results and trends in the data 
- Find patterns in the data to assist Louise in being as successful as possible with her business ideas

### Purpose
- Apply skills from the first module into an applicable scenario
- Challenge myself to create new ways to show how data can help people and businesses make decisions
- Familarize myself with coding and formulas in an Excel spreadsheet
- Utilize pivot tables, Excel commands, and various types of charts for visualization purposes

## Analysis and Challenges
1) Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
  - I created a Pivot table and set up the filters to allow me to only see the months a campaign was launched and whether or not it was successful. 
  - I filtered the table to only see theater campaigns
  - A line chart would work best to show the outcomes over a year.

2) Outcomes Based on Goals
  - In order to see a pattern for outcomes based on goals, I created a new table with multiple intervals for the goal amount for each campaign. 
  - I set up columns to show the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on their goal amount. Then I found the percentage of each interval that was successful to see any trends in the data. 
  - Again, I used a line chart to show the changes in successful and failed campaigns as the goal amount increased. 
  - To determine the number for each goal, I used the "countifs" formula in Excel, and set criteria to filter out only the play campgains in each interval.

 3) Challenges during Project
  - For the first part of the challenge, Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, I struggled at first creating the Pivot table to show the Rows as months instead of years. I knew I wanted to know the outcomes by month; "outcomes" was put correctly in the Columns section, and "Count of Outcomes" was successfully placed in the values section. Once I filterd the months to show in the Pivot table, the data was showing me exaclty what I wanted to know.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
