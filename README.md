# Kickstarter Analysis 

## Overview of Project
- Analyze large amounts of data from a kickstarter campaign data set
- Use visualizations to help show results and trends in the data 
- Find patterns in the data to assist Louise in being as successful as possible with her business ideas

### Purpose
- Apply skills from the first module into an applicable scenario
- Challenge myself to create new ways to show how data can help people and businesses make decisions
- Familarize myself with coding and formulas in an Excel spreadsheet
- Utilize pivot tables, Excel commands, and various types of charts for visualization purposes

## Analysis and Challenges
1) Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
  - I created a Pivot table and set up the filters to allow me to only see the months a campaign was launched and whether or not it was successful. 
  - I filtered the table to only see theater campaigns
  - A line chart would work best to show the outcomes over a year.
